# CPSC-362-Project
This is a repository that contains the content of the group porject that is assigned for the CPSC 362 course. 
This project will be called "Daily Social" to which is a website created for users to interact, blog, react, and post their interests on for everyone else to see. The idea is very similar to twitter and instagram but in this case it is much more simplified rather than complication efforts.
